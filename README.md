# DSA2019spring_hw4_Kosaraju
- Kosaraju's algorithm: find Strongly Connected Components on a directed graph
- language: C
- time complexity: O(V+E)

## input
- **first line** contains two integers **V, E** indicating *number of vertices* and *number of edges*, respectively.
- **each of the following E lines** contains two integers **u, v**, which means there is a directed edge <**u, v**> from **u** to **v**

## output
1. number of SCCs
2. corresponding SCC of each vertex
